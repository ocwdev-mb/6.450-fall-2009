Required Text
-------------

Course readings were taken from the following required text:

Gallager, Robert G. _Principles of Digital Communication_. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2008. ISBN: 9780521879071.

For an earlier version of this book, see lecture notes in the OpenCourseWare course _6.450 Principles of Digital Communication, Fall 2006_.

Reference Texts
---------------

The required text covers all the material in the course, but the following references can provide enrichment and additional examples.

1\. Proakis, John G. _Digital Communications_. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2000. ISBN: 9780072321111.  
This has a larger variety of systems than the class notes, but in less depth.

2\. Proakis, John G., and Masoud Salehi. _Communication Systems Engineering_. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2001. ISBN: 9780130617934.  
This is an undergraduate version of the above text.

3\. Wozencraft, John M., and Irwin Mark Jacobs. _Principles of Communication Engineering_. New York, NY: John Wiley and Sons, 1965. Reprint ed. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, 1990. ISBN: 9780881335545.  
Classic text that first developed the signal space view of communication.

4\. Wilson, Stephen G. _Digital Modulation and Coding_. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1995. ISBN: 9780132100717.  
Another text covering mostly the material of the last two thirds of the course.

5\. Gallager, Robert G. _Information Theory and Reliable Communication_. New York, NY: John Wiley and Sons, 1968. ISBN: 9780471290483.  
Treats most of the topics here in a more advanced information theoretic treatment.

6\. Cover, Thomas M., and Joy A. Thomas. _Elements of Information Theory_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Wiley Interscience, 2006. ISBN: 9780471241959.  
An excellent text on information theory.

7\. Tse, David, and Pramod Viswanath. _Fundamentals of Wireless Communication_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN: 9780521845274.  
Excellent coverage of many topics in the last third of the course.

8\. Goldsmith, Andrea. _Wireless Communications_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN: 9780521837163.  
An up-to-date text on wireless channels.

9\. Strang, Gilbert. _Introduction to Linear Algebra_. 3rd ed. Wellesley, MA: Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2003. ISBN: 9780961408893.

Papers
------

The following paper by Shannon laid the groundwork for developments in communication theory:

Shannon, Claude E. ["A Mathematical Theory of Communication. (PDF)](http://worrydream.com/refs/Shannon%20-%20A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication.pdf)" _The Bell System Technical Journal_ 27 (July/October 1948): 379-423 and 623-656.
